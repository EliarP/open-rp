## Introduction ##
Open Remote Play is an open source implementation of Sony Computer Entertainment's Remote Play protocol. Remote Play is a feature on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable which allows a PlayStation Portable user to interact with their PlayStation 3's Xross Media Bar.  Users can access music, videos, photos, PlayStation games, The PlayStation Store and various applications stored on the PlayStation 3's HDD, or external flash drives and optical media attached to the PlayStation 3.

## Requirements ##
You require a PlayStation Portable (or access to one), that is able to run _homebrew_ software.  The PSP must then be _registered_ (or paired) with the target PlayStation 3.  Before trying ORP, you should read the [FAQ](FAQ.md).  For installation/configuration instructions, see the included [README](http://code.google.com/p/open-rp/source/browse/trunk/README) file for more details.

## Credits ##
I would like to thank Dark\_AleX for hacking the PSP.  Without his work, ORP
would not be possible.  I would also like to thank TyRaNiD for psplink and
prxtool.  Using psplink makes this type of work almost painless!  Thanks to
jas0nuk for the essential PRXdecrypter utility.  Last but certainly not least, thanks to Greg for the MacBook loan, beta testing, and beer :)
