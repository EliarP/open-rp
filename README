Wouldn't it be cool if you could run Remote Play from your laptop, desktop, or
perhaps your phone?

After 2 weeks of hardcore reverse-engineering, now you can!

I would like to thank Dark_AleX for hacking the PSP.  Without his work, ORP
would not be possible.  I would also like to thank TyRaNiD for psplink and
prxtool.  Using psplink makes this type of work almost painless!  Thanks to
jas0nuk for the essential PRXdecrypter utility.

Controls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you connect your SIXAXIS or DualShock 3 controller to your PC *before* you
start Open Remote Play, it should be detected and automatically configured.
Remember to press the PlayStation button to activate the controller.

For Windows users, you require to download and install the DualShock driver:

Ensure that the controller is functioning properly by testing it using the
Game Controllers program found in the Control Panel.

The player currently implements these keyboard mappings:

ENTER           X
F1              Triangle
F2              Square
F3              Select
F4              Start
ESCAPE          Circle
PAGE-UP         L1
PAGE-DOWN       R1
ARROW KEYS      D-Pad
HOME            PS Button

CTRL-D		Toggle through window sizes (normal, medium, and large)
CTRL-F		Enter/exit full-screen mode
CTRL-Q          Quit Remote Play

Not implemented, yet:
The right/left analog sticks, L2, R2, L3, and R3.

NOTE: On Apple laptops, you may have to hold down the Fn key to access some of
the above keys.

The player currently implements the following mouse support:

While in full-screen mode, mouse motion deltas are sent as PSP D-Pad events
while the ALT key is held down.  In window-mode, mouse motion does nothing.
The mouse buttons are mapped the same as when you plug a USB mouse in to the
PS3:

LEFT BUTTON	X
RIGHT BUTTON	Triangle
MIDDLE BUTTON	Home

WHEEL UP	D-Pad Up
WHEEL DOWN	D-Pad Down

Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You require a PlayStation Portable (or access to one), that is able to run
homebrew software.

After installing the application on your PC, you need to import existing RP
settings from a registered PSP.  The steps are as follows:

1 - If you have not done so already, register your PSP with your PS3 for
    Remote Play.

2 - Copy the ORP_Export folder to your PSP under /PSP/GAME

3 - Run Open Remote Play Export on your PSP.  This will create a file on the
    memory stick called export.orp.  Copy this file to your PC.

4 - Run the ORP GUI and click on Import, locate and import export.orp.  You
    will have to manually change the IP address of your PS3, by default it
    will be set to 0.0.0.0.  I keep two profiles, one for local LAN and
    another for when I'm connecting from the Internet.  You can create
    multiple profiles by simply changing the Name field and clicking Save.

5 - Click Import again, this time locate and import keys.orp.  You only have
    to do this once for a new installation, or if there is a key update.

6 - Select a profile, cross your fingers, and click Launch!

Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "build system" (if you can call it that) is very simple.  For the player
and the GUI, edit the Makefile in each and uncomment the platform you wish to
build for.  For the GUI, ensure there are config sym-links:

        ./config.h -> ../config.h
        ./config.cpp -> ../config.cpp

If you'll be running the GUI from the gui directory, ensure you have created a
sym-link back to the player:

        ./orp -> ../orp

If you change any of the logos or images, run make images to generate the
required header file.

The psp directory contains the RP key export utility.  This requires the PSPSDK
to be installed and the $PSPDEV environment variable to be set accordingly.

The keys directory contains a simple tool to save the 3 RP static keys (only 2
are used).  I've seperated the keys in to the configuration file in case they
need to updated.
