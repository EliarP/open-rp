Wouldn't it be cool if you could run Remote Play from your laptop, desktop, or
perhaps your phone?

After 2 weeks of hardcore reverse-engineering, now you can!

I would like to thank Dark_AleX for hacking the PSP.  Without his work, ORP
would not be possible.  I would also like to thank TyRaNiD for psplink and
prxtool.  Using psplink makes this type of work almost painless!  Thanks to
jas0nuk for the essential PRXdecrypter utility.

Controls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The player currently implements these keyboard mappings:

ENTER           X
F1              Triangle
F2              Square
ESCAPE          Circle
PAGE-UP         L1
PAGE-DOWN       R1
ARROW KEYS      D-Pad
HOME            PS Button

CTRL-Q          Quit Remote Play

Not implemented, yet:
START, SELECT, and the analog nub.

Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing the application on your PC, you need to import existing RP
settings from a registered PSP.  The steps are as follows:

1 - If you have not done so already, register your PSP with your PS3 for
    Remote Play.

2 - Copy the ORP_Export folder to your PSP under /PSP/GAME

3 - Run Open Remote Play Export on your PSP.  This will create a file on the
    memory stick called export.orp.  Copy this file to your PC.

4 - Run the ORP GUI and click on Import, locate and import export.orp.  You
    will have to manually change the IP address of your PS3, by default it
    will be set to 0.0.0.0.  I keep two profiles, one for local LAN and
    another for when I'm connecting from the Internet.  You can create
    multiple profiles by simply changing the Name field and clicking Save.

5 - Click Import again, this time locate and import keys.orp.  You only have
    to do this once for a new installation, or if there is a key update.

6 - Select a profile, cross your fingers, and click Launch!

Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "build system" (if you can call it that) is very simple.  For the player
and the GUI, edit the Makefile in each and uncomment the platform you wish to
build for.  For the GUI, ensure there are config sym-links:

        ./config.h -> ../config.h
        ./config.cpp -> ../config.cpp

If you'll be running the GUI from the gui directory, ensure you have created a
sym-link back to the player:

        ./orp -> ../orp

If you change any of the logos or images, run make images to generate the
required header file.

The psp directory contains the RP key export utility.  This requires the PSPSDK
to be installed and the $PSPDEV environment variable to be set accordingly.

The keys directory contains a simple tool to save the 3 RP static keys (only 2
are used).  I've seperated the these keys in to the configuration file in case
we need to update them in the future.  You need to import keys.orp using the
GUI before using ORP for the first time.
