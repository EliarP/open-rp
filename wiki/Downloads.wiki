===Official Windows and OSX Releases===
All official releases are available at PS3-Hacks.com: http://www.ps3-hacks.com/tag/open-remote-play/

===Daily SVN Snapshots===
Daily SVN snapshots are automatically built for Windows and OSX at 12:00 AM EST every night whenever there is a new SVN revision.  These builds are for those that wish to follow the latest SVN but are not able/not willing to build their own.  *NOTE*: These builds are not guaranteed to run properly or even run at all.
