===Official Windows and OSX Releases===
All official releases are available at PS3-Hacks.com: http://www.ps3-hacks.com/tag/open-remote-play/

===SVN Snapshots===
SVN snapshots are automatically built for Windows and OSX whenever there are new revisions committed.  These builds are for those that wish to follow the latest trunk but are not able/not willing to build their own.  *NOTE*: These builds are not guaranteed to run properly or even run at all.
