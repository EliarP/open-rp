You only need two things to start:

  # SVN to download and update the source code.  I use [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN].
  # A complete MINGW32 + MSYS development environment which I have already done for you and can be downloaded [http://orp.ps3-hacks.com/packages/MINGW32-ORP.zip here].
