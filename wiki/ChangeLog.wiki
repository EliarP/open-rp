 * Mouse motion events are now sent only while holding the ALT key down from within
full-screen mode.

 * Switched to AVPacket structures in preparation for implementing proper audio/video synchronization (PTS/DTS).
 * Added PS3 'chime' sample which plays when a connection has been established.
 * Fixed missing windows icon.
 * Added support for left analog stick.
 * Added support for all SIXAXIS/DS3 buttons.
 * Added mouse support.
