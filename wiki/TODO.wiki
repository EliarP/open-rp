This is the Open Remote Play TODO list.  This list does *not* contain bugs, only features and functionality that yet to be implemented.  See the _[Issues]_ section to view or post bugs.

  * Add joystick support with a default SIXAXIS/DS3 button map.
  * Add proper audio+video synchronization (added a quick hack for now).
  * Add ability to set/manage buffering and bit-rate profiles.
  * Add error messages to the player instead of just bailing silently.
  * Implement power-on support.
  * Clean-up and document API.
